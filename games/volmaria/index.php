          <h4>Basics:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Death Ban:</b> 
              Upon death you will be banned for 3 days. This adds a real consequence to your actions. You
              can buy extra lives with the buy button above or get a MC Zone <a href="/donate">subscription</a>.
            </li>
            <li><b>PVP:</b> 
              Player versus player is enabled throughout the entire server except for the spawn. PVP is
              completely disabled for an hour upon joining the server for the first time.
            </li>
            <li><b>Factions:</b>
              Fight along as a team/clan with your friends against others. Form alliances and become the strongest
              and most powerful faction on the server! For more information on factions, click the link above.
            </li>
            <li><b>PVP Classes:</b>
              Wear specific armor sets and get benefits. Full leather grants you the Archer class, full gold is the
              Rogue class, and finally, chainmail armor makes you an Orc. Each class grants you different PVP powers.
              Click the "PVP Classes" link at the top for the details on each class.
            </li>
            <li><b>PVP Tweaks:</b>
              Certain potions and enchantments are disabled on Volmaria. This encourages balanced PVP and using
              classes such as Rogue and Archer rather than full dimaond.
            </li>
            <li><b>Online Map:</b>
              View faction homes and find a place for your own using the <a href="http://volmaria.com:8123">server dynmap</a>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="tab-pane" id="classes">
          <h3>Archer</h3>
          Full leather grants you the benefits of an archer. Damage done with a bow is doubled when the target is under 20 blocks. If the distance
          is greater than 20, the damage is mulitplied by the distance divided by 10. For instance, if you damage a player from 35 blocks away, you would
          deal 3.5x damage to that player (35 &div; 10 = 3.5).
          <br /><br />
          <b>Advantages:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Arrows can do significant damage when multiplied by 2x or greater. By adding other enchantments you can do even more damage!</li>
            <li>Do the most damage from long range attacks</li>
          </ul>
          <b>Disadvantages:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Very low protection! A diamond sword could kill you in just a few hits!</li>
          </ul>

          <hr />



          <h3>Heavy</h3>
          Wear full diamond armor and get the basic benefits of using the strongest mineral in the game.

          <b>Advantages:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Diamond armor!</li>

          </ul>
          <hr />

          <h3>Rogue</h3>

          An individual wielding a complete set of gold armor has the ability to gain various potion effects by holding or using specific items. The Rogue Class applies a given boost on a 
          timed interval based on the "Item in Hand" at the time the boost is to be applied. Timed Effects are applied every 5 seconds with a duration of 6 seconds (so if the same item is 
          continuously held the effect will stay constant)<br /><br />
          <ul>
          <li><em>Blaze Rod</em> - Strength I</li>
          <li><em>Ghast Tear</em> - Regeneration II</li>
          <li><em>Magma Cream</em> - Fire Resistance I</li>
          <li><em>Sugar</em> - Speed II</li>
          </ul><br />

          The Rogue Class also has some Instant Effect abilities. These Instant abilities are applied when the "Item In Hand" is "Right Clicked" however using an Instant Effect ability 
          creates a 30 second cool-down during witch time no other effect (Timed or Instant) can be used. Instant Effects: Are applied instantly when the "Item In Hand" is "Right Clicked"<br /><br />
          <ul>
          <li><em>Glistering Melon</em> - Heals 6 Hearts Instantly</li>
          <li><em>Wheat</em> - Heals 6 Hunger Instantly</li>
          <li><em>Nether Star</em> - 8 seconds of complete invisibility</li>
          </ul><br />

          <b>Advantages:</b>

            <li>Do the most damage from long range attacks</li>
          </ul>
          <b>Disadvantages:</b>

            <li>Very low protection! A diamond sword could kill you in just a few hits!</li>
          </ul>
          <hr />


          <h3>Orc</h3>

          Wear full chainmail armor and you will have the Orc class. Damage done with a diamond axe can do up to 3x the damage (much stronger than a diamond sword!)<br /><br />

          <b>Advantages:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Brute force with the diamond axe can do a lot of damage in an instant.</li>
          </ul>
          <b>Disadvantages:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Chainmail isn't the best armor, but it's decent.</li>
            <li>The inability to enchant the diamond axe.</li>
          </ul>

              <li>Mine down to Y=11 and start mining in the direction of your future base</li>
              <li>New players receive 60-minutes of PvP protection. This does not protect against mobs, falling damage, or other environment dangers.</li>
              <li><span class="command">/pvp time</span> allows you to check how much time you have before PvP protection runs is gone.</li>

            <p align="left"><strong>What are the main parts of the map?</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Spawn - The place where you sell iron/gold/diamond and are completely safe from PVP attacks (but not mobs). Teleport there by using the command, <span class="command">/spawn</span></li>
              <li>War Zone - It does not permit you to use buckets for lava reasons, and you shouldn't try to build a base in this area. You can not claim land in the war zone.</li>
              <li>Wilderness - The rest of the map. You can build anywhere and claim land for your faction, just be wary of other factions that may be nearby.</li>

            </ul>
            <p align="left"><strong>What is a faction? </strong></p>
            <p align="left">A faction is a group of people who</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Work together to pool resources and build a base.</li>
              <li>Make alliances and go to war with other factions.</li>
              <li>Build a base</li>
            </ol>
            <ul><li>Anything within a faction's land is protected, and individuals outside of a faction cannot open doors, break blocks, or open chests.</li></ul>
            <p align="left"><strong>How do I protect my faction land?</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Make sure your base is completely sealed. An enemy can ender pearl in through a single open block.</li>
              <li>Do not build right up to the edge of your chunk.</li>
              <li>Do not place anything that can be activated by redstone near the edge of your chunk, especially doors</li>
              <li>Place an easily breakable block like sand inside of your doors to protect from zombies and door glitches</li>
              <li>Use <span class="command">/f sc</span> to see the edges of your chunk</li>
              <li>Use doors to block off each room of your base to limit the movement of an enemy that gets in.</li>
              <li>Build an ender portal in your base in an enclosed area</li>
            </ul>
            <p align="left">What are the advantages and disadvantages of a faction?</p>
            
            <p align="left"><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Players in a faction can claim land. This land will not allow other players to change blocks or access chests. This means your goods, so long as your faction has the appropriate power to maintain its land, are safe and you can build top side structures to your pleasure.</li>
              <li>Players in a faction are immune to dealing damage to each other. A small but powerful advantage in group PvP.</li>
              <li>So long as you are 100 blocks away from any other player, you can use the <span class="command">/f home</span> command, which will take you to your faction home. This allows player a fast travel benefit, but ensures that they cannot escape combat with the command.</li>
            </ul>

            <p align="left"><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Claimed land is visible on the dynamic map. Any player in the server can see where your land is. You will always have to be on your toes.</li>
              <li>If you or other faction members die, your power level may fall below the amount required to claim land. When this happens, your land is free to be destroyed and your chests to be accessed. So with protection comes the risk of losing all your work.</li>
              <li>There are no peaceful factions and no individual ownership in faction land. You can be infiltrated, and all faction members can change the claimed land blocks and access chests / use doors.</li>
            </ul>

            <p align="left"><strong>Can I join a faction immediately?</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>While it is possible that you can join a faction, most players will not let you join until you have established yourself (meaning you have some diamonds and can contribute to the sustainability of the group).</li>
              <li>Instead of spamming the in-game chat asking to join a faction, try to work on establishing your own supplies and materials first, and then ask if a faction is recruiting, or just create one on your own.</li>
            </ul>

            <p align="left"><strong>Do I have to create a faction?</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>No. You can remain factionless and build your home in the wilderness. The experience remains like any other hardcore death ban server. You can kill people in factions and roam the world as a lone wolf. If you decide to make a faction later on, you can.</li>
              <li>If you choose this option, your stuff and all of your belongings can be looted and griefed at any time, so beware.</li>
            </ul>

            <p align="left"><strong>How do I create a faction?</strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Type <span class="command">/f create [faction name]</span> Replacing the '[faction name]' with your desired name.</li>
              <li>For the rest of this FAQ, we will assume you named your faction NOOBIES</li>
            </ul>

            <p align="left"><strong>How do factions claim and declaim land?</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong></strong>Factions can only claim land once they have 2 or more members.</li>
              <li>Claiming land costs in-game money, called Coins.</li>
              <li>Land costs 100 coins for the first claim, and 50 more thereafter. So it is 100 for first, 150 for second, 200 for third, ect?</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>You can claim land in two ways.</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Claim - type <span class="command">/f claim</span> - This claims the land you are standing on in a 16x16 area, from bedrock to block 256.</li>       
              <li>Autoclaim - Type <span class="command">/f autoclaim</span> - This will claim land that you walk on.</li>
            </ul>
            <p align="left"><strong>You can declaim land in 2 ways.</strong></p>

            <ul>
              <li>Type <span class="command">/f unclaim</span></li>
              <li>Type <span class="command">/f declaim</span></li>
              <li>Declaiming land returns to you 70% of the value of the land.</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>What important commands should I know once I make a faction?</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="command">/f sethome</span> - This allows you to create an area inside your claimed land that you can teleport to at almost any time.</li>
              <li><span class="command">/f home</span> - This costs 30 coins, and takes 30 seconds to warm up. It will teleport you to your faction home.</li>
              <li>If you are within 100 blocks of an opposing player, you will not be able to use this command.</li>
              <li><span class="command">/f open</span> - Opens your faction and allows anyone to join your faction.</li>
              <li><span class="command">/f close</span> - Closes your faction and requires an invite in order to join.</li>
              <li><span class="command">/f invite [player name]</span> - Invites a player to your faction. - Invite may be shortened to <span class="command">/f inv [player name]</span>.</li>

              <li> <span class="command">/f admin [player name]</span> - Hand over your admin rights to another member. Note that you are really handing it over. You will not be admin for the faction any longer. You will be turned into a officer, but the new admin could kick you any time.</li>
              <li><span class="command">/f kick [player name]</span> - Kick a player from the faction (will not work if player has negative power).</li>

              <li><span class="command">/f leave</span> - Allows you to leave the faction at as long as your power is positive.</li>
            </ul>

            <p align="left"><strong>What else can I do with a faction?</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="command">/f ally [faction name]</span> - Ally your faction with other factions. When you are allies, you cannot attack members of those factions, and they cannot attack you. * Note: Allies can build and destroy blocks on your land so choose allies carefully.</li>

              <li><span class="command">/f enemy [faction name] </span>- Places you in a hostile position with another faction.</li>
            </ul>

            <p align="left"><strong>How do factions claim my land, and how do I claim theirs?</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>A faction may claim your land if your power falls below zero, or if the number of plots you own is larger than the power of your faction.</li>
              <li>You may claim another faction's land if their power falls below zero, or if the number of plots they own is larger than the power of their faction.</li>
              <li>Claiming enemy faction land that is contested is 50 coins less than normal.</li>
            </ul>

            <p align="left"><strong>How does a faction's power increase or decrease?</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Each individual in a faction can reach a maximum power of 10.</li>
              <li>The more individuals in a faction, the more power a faction will have (2 players = 20, 3 players = 30, etc).</li>
              <li>Your power (and faction power) decreases over time if you do not play consistently.</li>
              <li>Your power (and faction power) decreases by 20 each time you or someone else dies, assuming they have full power.</li>
              <li>You lose 20 power on death. This means you go from +10 (maximum) to -10 (minimum). This means when you die, you actually hurt your faction, as you cause a total power swing of 20, whereas each faction member can only be worth 10.</li>
            </ul>
            <p align="left"><strong>If I die, do I respawn immediately?</strong></p>

            <ul>
              <li>If you die, there is a three day death ban, so use your time wisely and be on the lookout for any attackers.</li>
            </ul>

            <p align="left"><strong>How do I get coins, and how do I view how many coins I have?</strong></p>

          <h3>Archer</h3>
          Full leather grants you the benefits of an archer. Damage done with a bow is doubled when the target is under 20 blocks. If the distance
          is greater than 20, the damage is mulitplied by the distance divided by 10. For instance, if you damage a player from 35 blocks away, you would
          deal 3.5x damage to that player (35 &div; 10 = 3.5).

          timed interval based on the "Item in Hand" at the time the boost is to be applied. Timed Effects are applied every 5 seconds with a duration of 6 seconds (so if the same item is 
          continuously held the effect will stay constant)<br /><br />

          <li><em>Blaze Rod</em> - Strength I</li>

          The Rogue Class also has some Instant Effect abilities. These Instant abilities are applied when the "Item In Hand" is "Right Clicked" however using an Instant Effect ability 
          creates a 30 second cool-down during witch time no other effect (Timed or Instant) can be used. Instant Effects: Are applied instantly when the "Item In Hand" is "Right Clicked"<br /><br />
