mczone.co website circa 2013

This was one of my first PHP websites. It was a content management system for MC Zone, featuring custom forum software and user profiles with in-game statistics. 

I'm putting this up because it shows how I've progressed in just a few years.
This is surely not the way you should approach a PHP CMS; There are massive security flaws, performance issues and the code organization is a mess. But all programmers have to start somewhere, and this was a massive leap for me, so I'm very proud of it! 

Deal with it ヾ(⌐■_■)ノ
